Software Architecture
------------------------


**dynamicegem** package contains README files in dynamicegem and its sub directories including dynamicgem/dynamictriad, and dynamicgem/graph-generation directories containing explanation about the repository, its structure, setup, implemented methods, usage, dependencies, and other useful information for user guidance. The repository is organized in an easy to navigate manner. The subdirectories are organized based on the functionality which they serve as follows:

* dynamicegem/embedding: It contains implementation of the algorithms listed in section. In addition to dynamic graph embedding algorithms, this sub directory contains implementation for some static graph embedding methods on which the dynamic methods are built.

* dynamicegem/evaluation: It contains implementations of graph reconstruction, static and temporal link prediction and visualization for evaluation purposes.

* dynamicegem/utils: It contains implementation of utility functions for data preparation, plotting, embedding formatting, evaluation, and a variety of other functions that are building blocks of other functions.

* dynamicegem/graph-generation: It consists of functions to generate dynamic Stochastic Block Models (SBM) with diminishing community.

* dynamicegem/visualization: It contains functions for visualizing dynamic and static graph embeddings.

* dynamicegem/experiments: It contains useful hyper-parameter tuning function implementations.

* dynamicegem/test: It contains testing function used for coverage analysis, unit testing and functional testing.
