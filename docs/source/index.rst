####################################

**dynamicgem** is an open-source Python library for learning node representations of dynamic graphs. It consists of state-of-the-art algorithms for defining embeddings of nodes whose connections evolve over time. We have implemented various metrics to evaluate the state-of-the-art methods, and examples of evolving networks from various domains. We have easy-to-use functions to call and evaluate the methods and have extensive usage documentation. 

See the source code repository on github: https://github.com/Sujit-O/dynamicgem
